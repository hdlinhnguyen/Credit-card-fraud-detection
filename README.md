## Side Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection
A financial institution named "Trusty" has contracted us to improve the accuracy of their fraud detection machine learning model. The model is a binary classifier, but it is not working well because the data is imbalanced. To solve this problem as data scientists, this project will use generative adversarial networks (GANs), a type of Generative AI, to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions that are indistinguishable from real transactions. This will help to balance the dataset and improve the accuracy of the fraud detection model.
